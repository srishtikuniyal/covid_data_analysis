COVID-19 Data Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report provides an analysis of the COVID-19 dataset, focusing on key metrics related to the spread and impact of the virus across different countries/regions.

## Data Overview

The dataset includes information on various COVID-19 metrics, such as country/region, confirmed, deaths, recovered, active, new cases, new deaths, new recovered, deaths/100 cases, Recovered / 100 Cases, Deaths / 100 Recovered, Confirmed last week, 1 week change, 1 week % increase, and WHO Region.

## Key Findings

### 1. Geographic Distribution of Cases

- Utilizing a choropleth map, we visualized the worldwide distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases, highlighting regions with higher case numbers.

### 2. WHO Region Analysis

- A sunburst chart was used to represent the distribution of COVID-19 cases across different WHO regions.

### 3. Impact of 1 Week Changes

- A bar plot was generated to illustrate the 1-week change in COVID-19 cases by country/region. This provides insights into regions experiencing significant fluctuations.

### 4. Relationships Between Variables

- A pairplot was created using Seaborn to explore potential relationships between 'Deaths / 100 Recovered' and '1 week % increase'. This helps identify any correlations or patterns.

## Detailed Analysis

### Deaths/100 Cases

- The deaths/100 cases metric was analyzed to understand the fatality rate in different regions. Regions with higher rates may require closer attention and resource allocation.

### Recovered / 100 Cases

- Examining the ratio of recovered cases to total cases provides insights into the effectiveness of recovery efforts. A higher ratio indicates a more successful recovery rate.

### Deaths / 100 Recovered

- Analyzing the deaths/100 recovered metric offers insights into the severity of cases and the efficacy of healthcare systems in managing critical conditions.

### Confirmed Last Week and 1 Week Change

- Changes in confirmed cases over the past week were analyzed, shedding light on regions experiencing significant increases or decreases in infection rates.

### 1 Week % Increase

- This metric provides a percentage increase in cases over the past week, helping to identify regions with accelerating rates of infection.
